Game names:

add an identifier for optional articles
	eg: "3-D Battles of World Runner, The" => "3-D Battles of World Runner [The]"
		This returns only "3-D Battles of World Runner" for display and asset name, but also displays a gray-ish "The" above/before the title

add an identifier for possesive titles
	eg: "Adventures in the Magic Kingdom, Disney's " => "Adventures in the Magic Kingdom {Disney's}"
		This returns only "Adventures in the Magic Kingdom" for display and asset name, but also displays a gray-ish "Disney's" above/before the title

add an identifier for subtitles
	The identifier DOES NOT CHANGE asset naming, but DOES change display styling
	maybe just change the styling for the details pages not the list page

	e.g. "Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt [the]" (use after ':')
	MAKE SURE TO CONVERT FROM COMMAS TO COLONS EVERYWHERE

Meticulously fix all the assets and titles

fix asset pulling for things like acheivement pictures
	(add function in Game model)
change relationship pulling for Models
	(e.g. use elloquent instead of NesBasic::where(shit))

change seeding to use lists everywhere

Add hashes

Make a desktop app that can pull the NES db and compare hashes with a local folder


List Display:
	Add front/back/side selector buttons
	Paginate by alphabet


Asset restoration:
	make a way to shuffle assets and present them and I type 1-10 on keyboard to rate their quality so I can have a list of assets that I need to restore or find better versions
	maybe show rating on site somewhere

Asset use:
	find some way to discover if there are games that I have assets for that are not included in the gamelist


backlog:

add identifying things for utility carts (game genie), and unlicensed carts (aladdin deck enhancer, tengen)
better support for multi-carts
support to show alternative names for games
	including japanese/english translated localizations
support for hacked roms
	also translated roms as a special type of hacked roms
support for "prototypes" like cheetamen 2
support for famicom
cartiridge assets
screenshot assets
