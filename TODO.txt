Game names:

add an identifier for optional articles
	eg: "3-D Battles of World Runner, The" => "[The] 3-D Battles of World Runner"
		This returns only "3-D Battles of World Runner" for display and asset name, but also displays a gray-ish "The" above/before the title

add an identifier for possesive titles
	eg: "Adventures in the Magic Kingdom, Disney's " => "{Disney's} Adventures in the Magic Kingdom"
		This returns only "Adventures in the Magic Kingdom" for display and asset name, but also displays a gray-ish "Disney's" above/before the title

add an identifier for subtitles
	The identifier DOES NOT CHANGE asset naming, but DOES change display styling

	e.g. "Addams Family, The: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt" => "[The] Addams Family ~Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt~"

Meticulously fix all the assets and titles

Add hashes

Make a desktop app that can pull the NES db and compare hashes with a local folder
