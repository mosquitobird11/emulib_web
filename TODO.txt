Game names:

add an identifier for optional articles
	eg: "3-D Battles of World Runner, The" => "[The] 3-D Battles of World Runner"
		This returns only "3-D Battles of World Runner" for display and asset name, but also displays a gray-ish "The" above/before the title

add an identifier for possesive titles
	eg: "Adventures in the Magic Kingdom, Disney's " => "{Disney's} Adventures in the Magic Kingdom"
		This returns only "Adventures in the Magic Kingdom" for display and asset name, but also displays a gray-ish "Disney's" above/before the title

add an identifier for subtitles
	The identifier DOES NOT CHANGE asset naming, but DOES change display styling
	maybe just change the styling for the details pages not the list page

	e.g. "Addams Family, The: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt" => "[The] Addams Family ~Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt~"

Meticulously fix all the assets and titles

fix asset pulling for things like acheivement pictures
	(add function in Game model)
change relationship pulling for Models
	(e.g. use elloquent instead of NesBasic::where(shit))

Add hashes

Make a desktop app that can pull the NES db and compare hashes with a local folder
